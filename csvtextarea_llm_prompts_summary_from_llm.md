Here are the prompts you provided me:

1. **Initial Prompt**: You asked for the implementation of a `csv-textarea` web component that manages tabular data and allows editing of CSV content.

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Added functionality to insert a new row and cleanup empty rows.
   - Added a `debug` attribute to log detailed information about cell changes.
   - Added a debug button to log the current state of the focused cell, row, and CSV content when `debug` is enabled.

3. **Specific Requirements**:
   - Ensure that cells containing commas are properly quoted in the CSV content.
   - Ensure that the full value of a cell, including any quotes, is included in the `cell-changed` event.
   - Ensure that the number of columns remains consistent when updating cells.

4. **Issues and Fixes**:
   - Fixed issues where updating a cell with a comma affected subsequent cells.
   - Ensured that the debug button and logging provide detailed information about the current state of the CSV content.

5. **Final Implementation**: Provided the complete implementation of the `csv-textarea` component with all the requested features and fixes.

These prompts guided the development and refinement of the `csv-textarea` web component to meet your requirements.
