# JavaScript and TypeScript in this directory

Some of the web components like `textarea-csv` benefit from using external standard libraries available at <https://jsr.io>. This directory provides a means of maintaining the soruce code for the bundled version of the JavaScript distributed with the repository. Some web components may continue in JavaScript but we now have the option of writing them in TypeScript where needed.
