# Developer Notes

This is a new endevour for Caltech Library. Our practices are evolving as we devlop this project and we periodically make course corrections. In I hope to highlight approaches or technique that proved useful.

## Heuristics

- this project is focused on web components useful to Libraries, Archives and Museums
- when a component extends a standard HTML element the standard element name should be used as a prefix, e.g. `<textarea-agent-list>`, `<ul-a-to-z-list>`
